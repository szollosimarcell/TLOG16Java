# TLOG16Java

Welcome to the TimeLogger project! This little console application is just a simple java training program to precede
the main goal.

The project is about a logger application that allows users - usually workers in a company - to record their working hours
in different specific tasks.

There is a continuation of this project (still in process), which is supposed to be a rest application with a user friendly
front end.

This project was a part of a training course, which I took during my traineeship at a company. I hope you like it and feel free
to share your opinions and correct mistakes.
